        <h3>Mathura and Vrindavan</h3>
        <p>The Krishna Janmasthan Temple Complex is a group of Hindu temples in Mallapura, Mathura, Uttar Pradesh, India. These temples are built at the location where the Hindu deity Krishna is believed to be born, and is adjacent to the Eidgah mosque built by Aurangzeb.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7]
            The place has held religious significance since the 6th century BC.[8] The temples were destroyed multiple times throughout history, most recently by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in 1670. He built the Eidgah mosque there which still stands.[3][4][5][9][8] In 20th century, the new temple complex adjacent the mosque was built with the financial help from industrialists containing the Keshavdeva temple, the Garbha Griha temple at the birthplace and the Bhagavata Bhavan

            <h3>Kashi Vishwanath </h3>
            <p>The Kashi Vishwanath Temple is a famous Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. It is located in Vishwanath Gali of Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh in India. The temple stands on the western bank of the holy river Ganga, and is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, the holiest of Shiva temples. The main deity is known by the names Shri Vishwanath and Vishweshwara (IAST: Vishveshvara or Vishveshvur) literally meaning Lord of the Universe. Varanasi was called Kashi ("shining") in ancient times, and hence the temple is popularly called Kashi Vishwanath Temple.</p>

Estimates for the first Somnath temple vary between the early centuries of the 1st-millennium to about the 9th-century Ce.</p>

                    <h3> Golden Temple</h3>
                    <p>The Golden Temple or the Swarn Mandir (also known as the Harmandir Sahib, lit. 'abode of God', Punjabi pronunciation: [ɦəɾᵊmən̪d̪əɾᵊ saːɦ(ɪ)bᵊ], or the Darbār Sahib, 'exalted court', [d̪əɾᵊbaːɾᵊ saːɦ(ɪ)bᵊ]) is a gurdwara located in the city of Amritsar, Punjab, India.[2][3] It is the preeminent spiritual site of Sikhism.[2][4]

                        The word Harmandir means God’s House. The man-made pool was completed by the fourth Sikh Guru, Guru Ram Das, in 1577.[5][6] In 1604, Guru Arjan placed a copy of the Adi Granth in Harmandir Sahib.[2][7] The Gurdwara was repeatedly rebuilt by the Sikhs after it became a target of persecution and was destroyed several times by the Mughal, political parties and invading Afghan armies.[2][4][8] Maharaja Ranjit Singh, after founding the Sikh Empire, rebuilt it in marble and copper in 1809, and overlaid the sanctum with gold leaf in 1830. This has led to the name the Golden Temple</p>
